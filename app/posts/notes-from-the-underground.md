## Notes from the Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky 

### February 5, 2024

He is an anti-hero in the most cynical manner. Yet he lives in most of us. 

A twenty-five-year-old man's admittance to internal debauchery. Embarrassing... to spell the words out. Yet the need to avoid confrontation of human emotions; of intense jealousy of unmet possibilities lived by other people. The alienation of how society wills me to become vis-a-vis existential plight to be who I need to be - cracks in the surface running deep into the Earth's core. The repetitive self-description of "a wicked man" is as most vulnerable candor one can possess.

There is a lot to unpack - the first part of "Underground" brim of philosophical ruminations. On the next part, Apropos of the Wet Snow, his preclude to what has happened before he went underground, a man full of avoidance, anguish, sadness, albeit an self-awareness that placates him at his feet.

Time will tell when I fully resonate and be objective in the earnest manner. I will read this again sometime this year, after further enrichment of the mind.

Rating: 5 stars
