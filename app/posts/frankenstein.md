## Frankenstein by Mary Shelley

### December 31, 2023


Society throughout the history has never been kind in the unaesthetic and unnatural beings. It precludes a base instinct to be afraid of unsightly surfaces, arthropods, and the unknown. This sadly reflects the present beauty norm . Now you have ultra-bleached skins, thinned-out noses and jaws, and the countless diet fads to fit the ideal weighing scale. 

It does warrant the question of authenticity and vulnerability in the face of constant brutal fixation of beauty. In a chilling discovery, we find a being born out of the unnaturalness who ideates living with the community.  This presents a philosophical and ethical dilemma! Alas, he does not find belongingness and instead is thrown rocks, like a monster without self-awareness, until love is forced out of his life and consumed by madness. This is juxtaposed with the beauty of Europe, starting with Geneva, Switzerland and the French and German countryside. I love how there is eeriness and suspense as the story progresses. A madman at your coattail in every move is serious business. Frankenstein’s isolation on the problem concerning his creation is also a relatable situation that most of us have been in. We are expected to be able to solve problems in a fast-paced environment on our own, unknowingly furthering the anxiety of an individual. Still, how Frankenstein dealt the situation is unnervingly a constant source of annoyance to me. He made me fall in love with the alps of Switzerland, the countryside of French and Germany, and yet it only fueled his inability to be accountable of his decisions in life. There is wisdom in consulting with nature. It heals even the most wounded soul. But escapism has its limits!

On the other hand, I was fully moved by the creation’s plight to be loved and to be seen. His first interaction with humans and he is already prejudiced without given the privilege to make himself be understood by society. He is nurtured into becoming a monster! No one deserves to be deserted and unloved. Look at how people who grew up in uncaring homes turned out to become mentally unstable and emotionally lacking. It is pertinent for families to create a loving household to produce holistic adults.
