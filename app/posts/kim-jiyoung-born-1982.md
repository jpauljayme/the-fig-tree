I have written a list in my notepad but I'll spare you for tonight. The passivity in the text is maddening to me, languidly focusing on the drone of the narrator's voice akin to reading out loud a grocery list, and for twice helped me fall into a deep slumber. How mechanical can one person operate in their lives? I don't think this is reflective in actuality, for at times it comes across as a case study more than  narration, by creating an empty vessel of a protagonist being pulled by the strings, ultimately lacking in the emotional depth that I was anticipating if this was indeed a psychological ascent of a South Korean girl, woman, and a housewife tied in one.


Maybe it is Capitalism affecting the societal culture into absurdity despite the modernity, abolishing outdated marriage laws, occupying new equality offices, forcibly opening up the pipeline to women into choosing to toil endlessly in the fast-paced money-making machinery, don't you think?
