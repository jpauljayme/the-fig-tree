## The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka

### June 17, 2024

The world of philosophy, concerned with the ultimate questions of the universe, when seen from a casual eye, will scare and offer more riddles than clarity. Personally, setting a goal to read Existentialism, and to an extent its main writers - Camus, Sartre, Dostoevsky, is a task I seem to never start. Reading the first few pages from Myth of Sisyphus is as good as talking to a taciturn classmate - never declaring their intention intelligibly. How can I befriend them if I don’t have the knowledge of their history and the true nature of their heart?

Without the reintroduction of Sophie’s World, I would be more lost than I was at the age of twenty one, spewing random know-hows on the absurd. The author’s historical, textbook approach on the tryst between man and existence is an effective tool to see the flow from Plato, to the Renaissance, and a slow climb into the summit of modern day Existentialism. I probably highlighted most of the passages as they capture the essence of their respective zeitgeists. 

I am still on the fence with Sophie’s supposed education with a fifty year old man in the name of Alberto Knox, being in random spaces and eventually settling at his house without another adult supervision. It screams predatory to me, and guessing it’s a reflection of the time’s nuance of the age difference, just like Daddy Long Legs!

Putting down the book, on the tail end of the hyper-reality that I was plunged into, and the meta juxtaposition between the merged worlds of Sophie and Hilde, is a welcome gift that caught me by surprise even! Stupefying my realism in order to run together with the schemes, meeting fictional characters in the lines of Little Red Riding Hood and Winnie the Pooh, and a trip down memory lane, is a sweet ode to literature and my childhood. Surely this is a turning point with my philosophical inquiry, and the urgent voices in my head put in classroom mode, and I know I can finally uncover what is hidden in my internal landscape. My faith the morning star by my window, my wonder a kid playing the field of gumamelas, and my heart swimming in the depth of its mysteries.
