## Normal People by Sally Rooney 

### September 4, 2023

Definitely an easy read from the get-go! The familiar coming-of-age issues of familial pain and growing pains are written with a sense of honesty that you can expect. 

Throughout the ripening of their mutual understaning, we see unresolved trauma staining the clarity they've wanted to provide to one another. There is something beautiful in the simplicity of the prose as well. 

Vulnerability comes with responsibility and a lot of patience put into it.
