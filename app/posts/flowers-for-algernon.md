## Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes

### November 10, 2023


Charlie is invariably the central voice in the story as his reports depict his trajectory in an experiment to cure mental retardation. He carries a lofty smile with an eagerness to please those in his proximity despite being the constant butt of the jokes. What sets him apart from his peers is his despite need to read and learn that stems from his childhood trauma of being unwanted by his mother and sister. Algernon, the mouse, shares the arduous journey of being a creation of the scientists, Dr. Nemur and Dr. Strauss, into a failed experiment. His romantic and sexual facets are explored with Alice Kinnian and Fay Lillman. He grapples with the emotional complexities that come with heightened intelligence. As Charlie's intellect peaks, he discovers painful truths about his past and faces isolation.

The advent of Science and Technology to discover illnesses and make cure of them have been vital to the improved quality of life of humanity. However, mysteries are still being unraveled and the human mind comes to the forefront of the most complex structure of the universe. How one becomes who they are, thoughts firing at the speed of a millisecond, and how one missing gene can cause irreparable damage and eludes us to this day. The people in Charlie’s life invalidated the miracle of his surgery and instead lamented it as a curse. The unfairness of life’s imperfection does not fare well on the weighing scale. The absence of free will in this situation prevents anyone to experience life holistically.

The first time I read Flowers for Algernon was around college. I remember it as a life-changing piece of literature back then. Undeniably, the staggering emotional depth is consistent 5 years after. Picture this – an anxious mother, an alcoholic father, and an array of bullies throwing mischievous glances and throwing words. How can a child feel securely attached to the ground? He is in constant limbo of wanting to be loved and integrated to a community. The more I became smarter, the smaller the space I occupied in the classroom. The culmination is an uneven adult wanting to please everyone, low self-esteem, and an insatiable hunger to be whole. For people like Charlie, these things become part of their daily life since day one. The assurance of a family is an absolute need to fill the gaps. They require patience adjacent to their slow learning curve. If these supplementations are unmet, they might become a blackhole devoid of light and love. The cure is the genuine love and acceptance you will find in your intimate circle of friends, family, and nature.
