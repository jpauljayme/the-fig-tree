## Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl

### February 18, 2024

Self-transcendence. Tragic Optimism. How one should answer life's challenge of meaning. My words are incapable of fully drawing out the humanity out of life's enduring suffering. I don't need to. My statement is the sum of my actions reflecting values. Loving other people and animals. Experiencing the beauty of nature, art, music, literature, and the love-making I do with the world. The struggle of the daily bread I will do with enthusiasm to a certain degree. I choose to stay with my family and pets and see through today that they are well and loved.

The realities of my past are a testament of my legacy. The surviving from the ghetto into the reality on my own accord; forgiving the bullies of childhood; fostering love in a tense, love drought home; each chapter is my achievement and no one can take that away from me.

Rating: 5 stars
