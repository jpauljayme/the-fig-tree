    <h2>Recursion by Blake Crouch</h2>
<h3>August 29, 2023</h3>
<p>Once again, Blake Crouch delivers another thrill-driven, informative, and enticing scifi with Recursion! I love how the time-travelling dateline is not confusing, and instead keeps the pacing more fleshed out. </p>
<p>How the affliction of death is shown with the depiction of depression, restlessness, and vivid daydreaming is downright accurate. There is a stroke of realism and empathy as Barry navigates his memory lane, and excruciatingly trying to rewrite the continuous past and present. Including Helena's sorrow of being a child of a dementia-ridden parent is a one-two punch combo that will leave a permanent sense of facing death, memory, and time.</p>
