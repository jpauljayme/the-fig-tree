        <h2>Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov</h2>
<h3>April 27, 2024</h3>
<p>My first Nabokov book, without knowing his idiosyncratic writing and mischievous protagonists, is a weird, whirlwind experience. It consists of a dramatic 999-line poem, written by John Shade, a distinguished poet at Wordsmith College, New Wye, and the obsession entailing his new neighbor and colleague Charles Kinbote, John’s alter-ego. Charles is always on the prowl for John’s whereabouts, his art, and an ardent desire for control, possession, and validation from Shade's work, a manifestation of deeper psychological and possibly sexual impulses. A commentary is intertwined within the poem’s structure, basing on Kinbote’s own interpretations, both personal, a story of a Zemblan king, and the colorful passages of a revolution revolving the figure. </p>
<p>I was unnerved by Sybil, John’s dear wife, on her indifference and secretive responses to Charles, but it is probably her intuition in guarding her marriage and the husband’s art. The narrator seemed to wash out the confines of the timeline, for I have even forgotten that he was a recent alien in the neighborhood. </p>
<p>Around 70% of the story that my supposed stupefaction by the torrent of Zembla’s history did it finally click for me. From thereon, I purposefully detached myself from the frantic timelines, and the marathon became a walk in the park. The narrator merged with the Zambian king, then transporting into the neighbor in the person of Charles. Hallelujah! The layers of intrigue, with the narration becoming an unreliable web of woven delusion and truth. The nuances are lost to me now! How have I been mislead without a single whiff is beyond me. A lesson of conscientious reading and comprehension in lieu with the millions of literary and scholastic literature is an attitude the reader should possess. Do not trust every single word until a careful evaluation has been made.</p>
<p>From today thereupon, I declare my love for Nabokov, his pen, and the playfulness his palms provoke, with myself and his readers, and the chance encounter to read such provocative works.</p>
<p>Rating: 5 stars</p>
