    <h2>Eating Fire and Drinking Water by Arlene J. Chai</h2>
<h3>September 21, 2023</h3>
<p>How would you define living and what it means to be human? What would you do if your history is an endless patch of confusion, oppression, and pain? </p>
<p>"Watch Laslo. Observe human nature. See how Sophia, even while she is robbed of her wholeness or what humans call dignity, continues to fight for self-preservation As if it is possible to live when one is no longer whole." </p>
<p>Now imagine Rachminoff playing in the background. A man mercilessly toying the life force out of the love of your life. There is nothing more dehumanizing than marking them invaluable to live. Included in the scale are the thousands of salvaged lives butchered due to the megalomaniac dictator ruling your country. Striving to survive in the gargantuan, unjust system of society is a plight every simple man is encountering on a daily basis. </p>
<p>The story of Clara, Laslo, Sophia, Rogelio, and Charlie is a part of a larger plot in the causality of human oppression of greed and corruption. It is also one side of what it is to live as a human. In their eyes, to live is a brute-force fight of finding clarity in your history in order to exist in a lit path of understanding your human rights and a freedom off of oppression. The farmers have been suffering for the big span of civilized society. A huge number of broken families and orphaned children without a band-aid fix in sight.  Endless cycle of presidents with the promise to end poverty and social injustice only to be found mum and lie in front of the common mass or on a gavel.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, love permeates the cracks of what it means to be human. Volunteer groups helping the mass know their rights. Churches helping the poor and the broken. Families tending their own, understanding that it is with them that the hope starts to grow. Fearless journalists uncovering the murky waters under the bridge of the palace.</p>
<p>It is imperative for us to seek clarity within the noise of pandemonium. History is written by the hands of the victor. Never let anyone cloud your eyes from seeing what is real and what is an illusion. To want to live in spite of oppression is the most human way you can live.</p>
