        <h2>This Is How You Lose the Time War by Max Gladstone, Amal El-Mohtar</h2>
<h3>December 25, 2023</h3>
<p>Each page is a turner. Tantalizing imagery of multiple histories that I had to use the internet to fully grasp the encompassing eras they are in.</p>
<p>From one civilization to another, enhancing its strong points and removing the culprit of their downfall. Refining one strand to create the best reality out of millions. Red and Blue are drawn to this lofty goal. One belongs to the Commandant representing transhumanism - a super technological, disciplined organization. The latter of Garden - promoting nature and organic growth. Sowing seeds in written letters as they untangle the layers surrounding themselves despite fear of surveillance. Their love eclipses the ongoing war between the factions. Vulnerability in the face of danger reveals the heart’s true nature. Instead of bullets, can we propagate understanding and kindness across the timeline?</p>
