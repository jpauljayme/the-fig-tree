    <h2>Binti by Nnedi Okorafor</h2>
<h3>March 23, 2024</h3>
<p>This is a bit controversial read, given the stark difference in my enjoyment viz-a-vis the objective lens one should also wear in every review. For one, the author sparked a much needed conversation about racial prejudice in the life of a Nigerian woman and the black community as a whole. The anti-war sentiment was also a welcome to me, as I share a similar stance.</p>
<p>But after the back and forth with myself and the book club, I gathered a clearer understanding of its half-baked execution. The pages being 70 did not help, for there were no proper transitioning, pacing, despite the riveting introduction. I could not help but crinkle my forehead for the plot armor that catapulted the main character into a solution. She did not earn it like a hero's ample journey. The allure of the world and its mathematics fizzled that instant.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if one needs a quick read, then I can suggest this one for any fan of the sci-fi genre. March was a very illness-driven one that I needed a quick read to stimulate my mind again!</p>
<p>Rating: 2.5 stars</p>
