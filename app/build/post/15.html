    <h2>Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West: Love Letters by Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West</h2>
<h3>February 21, 2024</h3>
<p>This is the first epistolary novel I have read. A 20-year correspondence, slow burn, tender, rapturous plights vascillating, of two brilliant writers Virginia and Vita - romance, manuscripts, and all the illicit emotions conceived.</p>
<p>Virginia's prose, albeit not having read her works yet, is beguiling like lark's flight after a downpour. The sensitivity she allures the minds of most bountiful dressing. Juxtaposed is Vita's often lengthy passages of her colorful social life, of her multiple publications to Hogarth Press, and the donkey that she is, of her myriad of lovers a point of jealousy to Woolf. An affair worth acquainted into. Opening the portal to the history and literature on the onslaught of World War 2. </p>
<p>Let me perish and find the diary of my life interwoven with gripping passion, enduring grief, wearying acceptance, and the joy of continuing to live in spite of it all.</p>
<p>Rating: 5 stars</p>
