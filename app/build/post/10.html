        <h2>Educated by Tara Westover</h2>
<h3>January 13, 2024</h3>
<p>Imagine a person removed from modern society. Inculcated by a Mormon survivalist family. Then a small wedge in the door. A sneak peek at a world of antediluvian gates, history-filled walls, and lectures about the great civilization. To Tara, these are unfamiliar spaces. She was homeschooled in congruent to her father’s belief that the government made schools as a mind-control ground. Instead, her world consisted of the beautiful Buck’s Peak - a bountiful land of peaks and valleys; of standing between  rebars to build structures; of finding gold in scrapyards; of the fear melding in her pores as her father’s fear of the rapture and her brother, Shawn, crushing his weight unto her fragile bones. An adolescence riddled with abuse and self-incrimination. </p>
<p>A leap of faith forced her to self-study Mathematics and passed the GED into Brigham Young University. Rediscovering the world unbeknownst to her; first the horrors of the Holocaust, then the Civil Rights movement spearheaded by Martin Luther King Jr., her ignorance to the world finally became clear as day.  Her ignorance and lack of financial support were an impetus on further social isolation as she integrated into society. Coalescing between horror and wonder, challenging her beliefs, and even changing them, as she pursuits the endeavor of education. One part mind, the other an angelic voice, she is a force to be reckoned with. </p>
<p>We could easily vilify the Westover family under the brainwashing of Mormonism. Weave in under familial love and the paths become more complicated. Yet, Tara understood the nuances of history. People become afflicted with various degrees of historical tangents. That her father suffered from Bipolar disorder, coupled with extreme religious trauma. Her love is unwavering throughout in spite of the antecedents. She has battled shame throughout her life. Hate coexisted within. It wasn’t that her parents were delusional. It is from the knowledge of a father who shoved her towards the chomping blades of the Shear, instead of pulling her away . Of knowing that  her Mother choosing to ignore her plaintiff cries and bruised lungs.</p>
<p>As I pore through her memoir, a familiar sisterhood connected my own thread to hers. Of having a dysfunctional family enclosed in two separate religions lies a questioning boy. On a closer look, his earnest eyes were met with admonition and a searing belt. Do you hurt the people you love? </p>
<p>An answered prayer came in the form of my education. Scholarships catapulted my mind into foreign environments and wider libraries my eyes can set on. The wider the net I casted, the heavier the load became. To my dismay, self-discovery is fraught with numerous uncomfortable situations. These feelings I am still challenging presently.  Callous hands and a pair of eager eyes, I continue to ambivalently breathe in this world. A kinship with a stranger in the face of Tara I wield hope of my mind setting me free.</p>
<p>Rating: 5 stars</p>
