        <h2>The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion</h2>
<h3>November 9, 2024</h3>
<p>It started as a tender night of October 31, 2024, halloween on most places, me uncaring since I do not heed to such practices, but found myself going to my usual path to FullyBooked Ayala Cebu. I was out of my working hours and I wanted to smell the books one more time. It was this or the probability of being consumed by the vapors of mourning ahead of the mourners in the cemeteries for the coming days.</p>
<p>The book was placed between the classics, of Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Jane Austen, the solitary contemporary writer, having heard of Joan Didion from Des who prompted me to read more female authors. They usually have more interesting viewpoints of things, she says as delicately to my still rekindling cognitive highway. So I took the book and started to read the first three pages, enamored on the stream of consciousness jumping off the paper, the restlessness, grief, uncertainty, themes so familiar to me, and spoke to me at gunpoint. It chose me for that night, the deer in headlights.</p>
<p>Didion's accounts of the death succumbing her husband, John Didion, and the crossroads of her only daughter Quintana acquiring sepsis and debilitation in the coming days, a buy one-take-one promotion no one asked for, but the balancing of the scales, as Quintana used to say as a kid when herself experience two deaths in the family, were the insurmountable trek Joan had to take. Scorned with the passivity of grief, the indelible but oftentimes difficult mourning period that we try to avoid, for the Western Idea is "growing, flourishing from the trauma of the passing", putting a brave face on, and continuing the futility of the daily routine. </p>
<p>Joan used her writer's wit, proved by diligent research on death's customs and historical data, as a way to manage the ruthlessness, helplessness of the fragility of the human condition, and finding mostly nothing warm to accompany the pervasive coldness, a common experience for the bereaved, instead warping the day with the memorized steps to account for it. No one seemed to acknowledge the cognitive failures but herself. I experienced this paralysis too - the circulatory, nervous, and autonomous systems, resulting in the lack of focus, social energy, and the lower rate of productivity at work.</p>
<p>The world does not want us to grieve freely. It always comes at a cost too high for us to bear. The question I leave today is, how will I do in the coming months of Jazel's chemotherapy and the high mortality of her condition? Will I lose myself again, like the previous passing of my other sister, destined for another failure in my career and other facets of my being? </p>
<p>Can Literature become my oasis again?</p>
