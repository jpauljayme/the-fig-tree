        <h2>Sea of Tranquility by Emily St. John Mandel</h2>
<h3>January 27, 2024</h3>
<p>I first read this book at the start of 2023, when I found myself wanting to restart by reading habits beset by brain fog and devoid of focus. A winner of the yearly Goodreads Best Science Fiction of 2022, I was eager to devour the pages. Things began awry and I left it hanging in my Kindle.</p>
<p>A year after the thought and a renewed mind besought to tie the loose ends of my reading list. Sea of Tranquility did not disappoint. Smooth as Ube Halaya spread in a Pan De Monay in a quiet Saturday afternoon. The curious case of time travel never ceases to amuse me. Interconnected threads of people across generations draws a cocoon of love and humanity that reality sometimes lack. </p>
<p>Gaspery weaves in the histories of three people who have witnessed a glitch in the simulation, as they paint it. How intricate their personal stories be wrought in careful strokes of letters. Gaspery's life of inaction seemingly thrown into a heist of investigating the anomaly and how a lack humanity in our professions instills harmony against the smokescreen to me. That the Time Institute will throw anyone once they deemed useless to the bureaucracy of a faceless mix of government and private eye should serve as a reminder to all of us.</p>
<p>In the cacophony of morning rush, smoke-emitting vehicles, and incessant whirs of machines; when people have already moved too fast, too far, I wished to travel no further too. To be as still as a drop in a sea of stillness is what my life is about now. To create my own web of human connection, of animals; of a myriad of books and music to look forward to each day.</p>
<p>Rating: 4.5 stars</p>
