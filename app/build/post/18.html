        <h2>Hunger by Knut Hamsun</h2>
<h3>April 17, 2024</h3>
<p>In a moment of wanting to let feelings pass by, an eye of the storm, me the city of Kansas, searching for bread that could fix my hunger. Lying in my shelf was Knut Hamsun’s similar fate, calling me to read him, pulling me from shallow waters.</p>
<p>An autobiography, the life of a failed writer coming from a flop in America, to his life as a wanderer in the cold streets, and a battle with extreme poverty and hunger. Despite the situation, his honor defers him from seeking help, after countless refusals from friends. Concealing the nature of his pain is his respectful, pious attitude towards the citizens of his locality, honorifics let to right, and an image of truthful labor. He has done everything from vacating his rental room and selling his only garments in an attempt to stave off the gnawing hunger and to write his piece in the newspaper that could provide him ten kroner. </p>
<p>Despite his obvious talent, the community never seemed to accept himself as a productive part of it. The dizzying steps one must go through to put food on the table is downright dystopian. A degradation of courage! He’s applied as a fireman, only to be disqualified due to his eyeglasses. A cashier, only to be removed minutes after an error in calculating, mainly due to his slowed mind as a symptom of malnourishment. Wasn’t everyone promised of equal opportunities? The proletariat’s plight of a livable reality is a poison that is slowly killing them. Emaciated fingers, a brittle back, an animal in a frenzy - burrowing into your pit and an early onset of hair fall. These are some immediate effects of intense hunger. It does not stop there! The deluge of mood swings, grandeur delusions, and cries of helplessness, a frequency only you can hear. Trampled ego grinded into dust. Lower than a pig! </p>
<p>Even the grace of God has neglected him, too. The fight for the daily bread is its own maze. Shouldn’t the prayer found on Matthew 6:11 a sufficient display of His love? Why he should be troubled for what he should eat or drink was one of Hamsun’s main platitudes, and a resonating echo across the globe. If God fed the minute birds, provided shade when it rains, then is man’s value, his lowly servant, so diminished that it escapes His memory?</p>
<p>His story reminds me of Job. Job 7: 16 (New World Translation) relays that “he loathed his life; did not want to go on living…For his days are like a breath.” One may be led astray from the road. Impoverished, without shelter, or a loss of job. Your friends might not even lend a hand. No one in sight to mend your fractured heart. In due time, this is how the light gets in. In the faces of kindness, from strangers to loved ones, would prove surprising and moving, With Hamsun, his editor gave him ten kroner and Ylayali, the same amount. His tears were abundant on those moments. Like gold gluing the lines of an olden vase, producing a more beautiful handicraft. You will come out a more suited man for the whole world to deter. Therefore, it is pivotal for someone to have his solid ground, a community to grasp his shaky hands, fill his water carrier, and grains of rice to ease the hunger.</p>
<p>Rating: 5 stars</p>
